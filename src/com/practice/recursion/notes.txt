** How to understand and approach a problem
1. Identify if you could breakdown the problem in to smaller problems
2. Write down the recurrence relation
3. Draw the recursive tree
4. About the tree
    1. See the flow of functions. How they are getting in stack.
    2. Identify and focus on left tree calls and right tree calls.
    3. Draw the tree and pointers again and again using pen and paper.
    4. Use a debugger to see the flow.
5. See how the values are returned at each step. See where the function call will come out of, in the end you will come out of the main function.
